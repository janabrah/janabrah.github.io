            Ferrovolcanism refers to volcanic eruptions of molten iron, which may occur
            on metallic asteroids—the exposed iron cores of differentiated planetesimals.

            This research explores the conditions under which ferrovolcanism could occur,
            the morphology of resulting surface features, and how we might identify evidence
            of ferrovolcanism on asteroids like Psyche.
