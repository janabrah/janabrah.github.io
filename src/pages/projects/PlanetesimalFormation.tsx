          <p>
            Planetesimals are the building blocks of planets. Understanding how they formed
            in the early solar system is crucial for understanding the diversity of planets
            and small bodies we observe today.

            My research investigates the physical and chemical processes involved in
            planetesimal formation, including the role of moderately volatile elements.
