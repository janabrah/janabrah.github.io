          <p>
            The Moon once had a magnetic field, as evidenced by magnetized rocks returned
            by the Apollo missions. Understanding how this ancient dynamo operated provides
            insights into the thermal and chemical evolution of the lunar interior.

            My research investigates the mechanisms that could have powered and sustained
            the lunar dynamo over billions of years of lunar history.
